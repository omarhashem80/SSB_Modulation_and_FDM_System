# üì° **SSB Modulation and FDM Project**  

This project implements **Single Sideband (SSB) Modulation** within a **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** system to modulate and transmit three speech signals. The project includes signal recording, filtering, modulation, demodulation, and spectrum analysis, following the principles of communication systems.

## üìú **Overview**  

The project demonstrates SSB modulation using MATLAB for signal recording and Python for the signal processing pipeline. It explores signal filtering, modulation, and demodulation, ensuring compliance with the sampling theorem.  

### **Objectives**  

1. Record and process three audio signals for modulation.  
2. Apply low-pass filtering to limit the maximum frequency without compromising audio quality.  
3. Perform SSB modulation for a frequency-division multiplexed system.  
4. Analyze the spectrum of signals at various stages: original, filtered, modulated, and demodulated.  
5. Recover original signals through SSB demodulation and compare their quality.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/omarhashem80/SSB_Modulation_and_FDM_System.git
cd SSB_Modulation_and_FDM_System
```

```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### **3. Run the Project**  
Execute the `process()` method to record, filter, modulate, and demodulate signals.  
```python  
from SSB_FDM import SSB_FDM  

processor = SSB_FDM()  
processor.process(['input1.wav', 'input2.wav', 'input3.wav'], ['output1.wav', 'output2.wav', 'output3.wav'])  
```

## üåü **Features in Action**  

1. **SSB Modulation**  
   - Each input signal is modulated using a unique carrier frequency.  
   - Ensures no spectral overlap in the FDM system.  

2. **SSB Demodulation**  
   - Recovers original signals with minimal distortion.  
   - Normalizes output signals for consistency.  

3. **Spectral Analysis**  
   - Visualizations of signal transformations across stages.
